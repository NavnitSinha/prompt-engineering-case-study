Model Behavior Comparison: 
  When working with ChatGPT, Gemini AI and Claude AI the observation was made that these models differ from each other a lot. 
  Obviously the models were made to do tasks for the users however the way these models work differ more than expected. Each of 
  these models have their own strengths and weaknesses and the breakdown of each model’s working is definitely interesting to 
  see. When talking about how interactive the model is, ChatGPT is neutral and can be talkative, that totally depends on how the 
  user wants to move forward with the chat. This model is interactive and can do the tasks in a very interactive way which is 
  quite interesting. Moving on with the Gemini AI, this model works amazingly, however it’s not much interactive, which leads 
  to a boring chat (to someone who wants to go ahead and chat with the model). It sure asks counter questions however the way it
  talks is plain, Gemini’s responses often feel reserved — while it asks follow-up questions, its tone lacks warmth and 
  spontaneity, making conversations feel stiff. However when it comes to Claude AI, the model works fantastic when it comes to 
  providing you with the tasks and is interactive while working with it. It’s actually amazing that the bot surely goes ahead 
  and makes the chat flow while asking counter questions to keep the chat flowing until the user wants.
