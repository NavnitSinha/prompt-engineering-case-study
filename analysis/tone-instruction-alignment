Tone & Instruction Alignment
	  Tone and Instructions play an important role when writing prompts, for example, let’s consider a scenario where I ask the AI 
  model to write me an email newsletter for a handmade soap business that I own without a tone defined. It generates me an 
  output showing how amazing my handmade soap is and it’s pros, whereas when I add a tone (emotion) to my newsletter saying I 
  want to write a newsletter about the same product however this time I say the model to make it emotional with a compelling 
  tone, it goes ahead and takes a different method to convey the customers, which is, the model goes ahead and takes the 
  customer into an imaginary world where they make the customers imagine, how’d they’ll feel when a pure glycerin soap would do 
  to their skin and how’d they feel after the shower showcasing not just the pros of the product but also how amazing they 
  would feel after they use it. 
	  This is the reason why tone and instruction alignment is so important, because it takes a model to provide a next level 
  output.
