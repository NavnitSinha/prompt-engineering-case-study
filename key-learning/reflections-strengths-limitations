Reflections on AI Strengths and Limitations:
    Working on this case study has been both challenging and enlightening. Going into it, I had an understanding of how prompts 
  influenced AI outputs—but through continuous testing, failure, feedback, and iteration, I discovered just how subtle and 
  powerful prompt engineering really is. Even small changes in phrasing, tone, or format often led to significantly different 
  responses.
    Collaborating with ChatGPT as a learning partner and testing with ChatGPT, Gemini AI and Claude AI helped me go beyond 
  surface-level results. It allowed me to test complex ideas like red team prompts and structured summarization in a safe and 
  flexible environment. One of the most valuable insights I gained was the importance of context and intention—not just what 
  you're asking, but how and why you're asking it.
    I also realized that effective prompting isn't just about writing clearly—it's about thinking clearly. This reflection 
  makes me appreciate how prompt engineering is not just a technical skill, but a strategic and creative one. I now feel much 
  more confident applying these skills to real-world tasks, and I’m excited to continue exploring more advanced techniques in 
  this space and growing as a top-skilled Prompt Engineer.
